socialfixer-filters
===================

Filters/options for SocialFixer that block sites that annoy me.

I don't like sites that don't offer content of their own and,
instead, try to craft headlines that appeal only to curiosity
while providing little to no content of their own apart from
some witty headline.

You've probably seen them them in your Facebook feed:

  "Pet gets run over by train!  You'll never believe what happened next!"
   (and, predictably, it shows the poor owners fraught with grief)

  "56 reasons why shellfish will rule the world by 2042!"
   (and, predictably, consumption of the content is for your brain
   what marshmallow consumption is for your body)

So, I use SocialFixer with a configuration that allows me to
block them.

If you're looking at this on github, simply go to the 
'User Preferences' tab in SocialFixer and paste the content from:

   https://raw2.github.com/lhh/socialfixer-filters/master/filter-config.txt

...in to it, then click 'import'.

WARNING: It will overwrite your entire configuration.

Also, I've only used SocialFixer 9.
